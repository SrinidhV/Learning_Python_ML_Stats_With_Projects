# My Python Data Science Journey

This repository is a living record of my learning and exploration in the world of Python data science. It currently focuses on data cleaning and exploration techniques, but will expand to include broader Python topics like statistics, machine learning, and more as my journey continues.

## What's Inside

* **Code:** Practical Python scripts demonstrating data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory analysis techniques.
* **Datasets:** A variety of datasets used for practice and experimentation.
* **Notes:** My personal notes and observations on the concepts and techniques I'm learning.

## Current Focus: Data Cleaning & Exploration

The current content primarily showcases my progress in:

* **Data Wrangling:** Handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in data.
* **Data Transformation:** Cleaning, standardizing, and preparing data for analysis.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Using visualization and summary statistics to uncover patterns and insights in data.

## Future Goals

This repository will evolve alongside my Python learning journey. I plan to add content related to:

* **Statistics:** Implementing statistical concepts and methods in Python.
* **Machine Learning:** Exploring various machine learning algorithms and techniques.
* **[Add any other specific areas of interest here]**
